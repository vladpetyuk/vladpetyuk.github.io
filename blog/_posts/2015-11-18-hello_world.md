It did really feel that I need a place on the web for self-expression.  I think I can add some value with my posts of my biomedical research, computational biology and perhaps math in general.

As an acknowledgement I'd like to point out a few `github.io` sites that I used for figuring out how this `R/Jekyll/GitHub` thing works.
