I am planning to post quite a few things on computation and R. This is a basic post that demonstrates the capability.

1. the `.Rmd` file is created as usual. It should be in `/blog/_R` folder
2. Run `_knitposts.R` from the main directory of the repository. The paths should be set accordingly so it knows where to take the `.Rmd` file from and where to put the resulting `.md` and picture files for rendering with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
3. It should be good to go now.



{% highlight r %}
set.seed(0)
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- rnorm(10)
plot(x, y)
{% endhighlight %}
