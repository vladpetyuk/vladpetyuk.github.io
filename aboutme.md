##Education
* __1992-1997:__ specialist (BS/MS) in chemistry from the [Novosibirsk State University][NSU]
* __1997-2001:__ PhD in biochemistry from the [Novosibirsk State University][NSU]. The actual work has been performed at the [Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine](ICBFM)
* __2008-2011:__ equivalent to BS minor in computer science from [North Carolina State University][NCSU]
* __present:__ My life as probably anyone else's is a continuous learning process.

<!--
* __Formal:__ I finished my PhD in the [Novosibirsk State University][NSU] in 2001. My thesis was focused on thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleic acid interaction involving structured regions. See my publications at [NCBI collection][ncbi_collection] page.
* __Informal:__ My life as probably anyone else's is a continuous learning process.

##Post-Doc Training
* __2001-2004__ protein engineering of site-specific recombinase Cre in Dr. Brian Sauer lab at [OMRF][OMRF] and [Stowers Institute for Medical Research][SIMR]
* __2004-2006__ LC-MS proteomics in [Dr. Richard Smith lab][SmithLab] at [Pacific Northwerst National Laboratory](www.pnnl.gov)

##Work 
Since 2006 I have been working as a senior scientist at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory][PNNL]. See my publications at [NCBI collection][ncbi_collection] page.
