## R/Bioconductor tools for proteomics

Modern day biology is data intensive. Proteomics is not an exception. The range of tools that I apply in my work span from signal processing of mass spectra, data reduction and feature finding to detect and quantify peptides and proteins, and variety of statistical and machine learning tools to detect the changes associated with biological and clinical phenotypes.

## Proteomics

In my definition, proteomics is just a set of protein characterization tools that is capable of high-throughput and multiplexing.  These days it is arguably most effective and versatile to use mass spectrometry-based approaches for the purpose of protein characterization. Mass spectrometers allow to:

* identify proteins and their splice isoforms
* quantify
* detect numerous post-translational modifications
* determine protein localization
* identify and quantify interacting partners
* measure their synthesis and degradation (turnover) rates



## Parkinson's disease

Quoting one of the investigators who has discovered involvement of alpha-synuclein protein into Parkinson's disease - ["Parkinson's disease is going to be a 100-piece puzzle. α-Synuclein may be a central piece of the puzzle and will hopefully give us a picture of what it will look like when it is done. But we should be prepared for another 99 pieces.”](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/276/5321/1973.long)  Besides clear biomedical urgency to find out better treatment and management options for the Parkinson's disease, it is a tough scientific problem.  Although there has been a great progress been made in understanding the molecular mechanism of the disease, still we are far from complete picture made of aforementioned 100 pieces. 

My research project focuses on understanding the causes behind Lewy body generation and development of cerebrospinal fluid protein biomarkers that would be indicative of Lewy body presence.



## Aging

I have been productively collaborating with the [Braeckman Lab](http://www.physiology.ugent.be/People/people.html) at the University of Ghent (Belgium) on studying aging processes using the model organism _Caenorhabditis elegans_.  We use proteomics tools for quantifying relative protein abundance changes and changes in protein turnover to get a glimpse in understanding what is going on with organisms during aging and what determines longevity.
